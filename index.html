    <p>At CMIC Chess Center in Gampaha, Sri Lanka, our training program is built on a strong four-course foundation designed to develop complete, world-class players. The first course, Begin With Openings, introduces students to essential opening principles, helping them understand development, center control, and early strategic planning. The second course, Strategy in Openings, goes deeper by teaching students how to choose openings that match their style, recognize common patterns, and prepare for different opponent responses. Our third course, Middle Game Theory, focuses on tactics, calculation, planning, and piece coordination to build strong decision-making skills. Finally, the Endgame Course trains players to convert advantages, defend difficult positions, and master essential endgame techniques. Together, these four courses create a complete learning path that builds confidence, understanding, and competitive strength in every student.</p>
